# Sanity for March Madness
Do you know little to nothing about NCAA basketball? Are you very lazy? Have you half-heartedly entered a March Madness pool with your office, family or social circle?

You've come to the right code repository!

**SFMM is a tool that lets you fill out your own custom March Madness bracket with the click of a button.**

We use proprietary, highly advanced analytics (random pick of each game winner based on seed matchup) to auto-fill the entire NCAA bracket so you don't have to.

This tool requires you to have python installed on your computer. Simply clone the repository, and run the following command from the top-level directory:
`python python/bracket_filler.py`

A neatly formatted txt file will be generated in the `data` directory.

Don't like your bracket? **Run it again!** A brand new bracket will be generated. Repeat until results are satisfactory.
